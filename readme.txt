CartHook helps you increase revenue by automatically recovering abandoned carts.


== Description ==

You probably know that well over 50% of shopping carts are abandoned. It happens to you, to Amazon, to Zappos, and everybody else selling online.

Have you checked your abandoned carts lately?

Painful, isn't it? All that work (and money) you put into getting these people to your store, to the product page, and finally to the shopping cart. Only to see them walk away before purchasing?!?

[CartHook](http://carthook.com/) is a new way to recover those abandoned carts.

== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =
Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "CartHook for WooCommerce" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found our plugin you can view details about it such as the the release date, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our eCommerce plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

The plugin should automatically update with new features, but you could always download the new version of the plugin and manually update the same way you would manually install.
